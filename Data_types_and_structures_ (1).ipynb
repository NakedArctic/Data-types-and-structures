Python's dictionary allows you to store key-value pairs, and then pass the dictionary a key to quickly retrieve its corresponding value.

        "\n",
        "Tuples are designed to be immutable, making them more memory-efficient and faster than lists for certain operations.\n",
        "Immutability ensures that tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets, which require immutable objects.\n",
        "Safety and Integrity:\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutability prevents accidental changes to data, which is especially useful when passing data between functions or across different parts of a program.\n",
        "What Happens If You Try to Modify a Tuple?\n",
        "Since tuples do not support item assignment, attempting to change an element will raise a TypeError. For example:\n",

        "Indirect Ways to Modify Tuple Content\n",
        "Although you cannot modify a tuple itself, you can:\n",
        "\n",
        "Reassign the Entire Tuple:\n",
        "\n",
        "You can assign a new value to the variable holding the tuple, effectively replacing the original tuple with a new one.\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "my_tuple = (4, 5, 6)  # Reassignment to a new tuple\n",
        "print(my_tuple)  # Output: (4, 5, 6)\n",
        "Modify Mutable Elements Inside a Tuple:\n",
        "\n",
        "If a tuple contains mutable elements like lists, you can modify the contents of those mutable elements.\n",
        "python\n",

        "print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, [10, 3], 4)\n",
        "However, the structure of the tuple itself (its length and order) remains immutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion\n",
        "Tuples are immutable to provide benefits like efficiency, safety, and usability in contexts requiring fixed data. If you need a modifiable sequence, you should use a list instead."
